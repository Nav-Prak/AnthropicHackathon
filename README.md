# PurpleOps
The idea for PurpleOps was born from a frustration we constantly faced: while cybersecurity tools and AI models have advanced significantly, AI red teaming and security auditing remained disconnected, manual, and difficult to integrate into workflows. We wanted something different — a modern AI copilot built for security teams, not just researchers.
Inspired by the legends of purple teams in cybersecurity — where red (attack) and blue (defense) combine — PurpleOps was designed to be the assistant that merges the offensive creativity of a red teamer with the precision of an AI defender. We envisioned a world where AI could not only simulate attacks but proactively suggest vulnerabilities, assist in CTFs, and guide forensic investigations, all from a clean, intuitive interface.
PurpleOps isn't just a tool. It's your tactical AI teammate.
